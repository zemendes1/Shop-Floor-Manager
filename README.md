# Shop Floor Manager

**Shop Floor Manager** is a Python-based manufacturing execution system (MES) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution developed for the course "Industrial Informatics." It includes a Master Production Schedule (MPS) module, receives orders in XML format, and connects to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) using OPC UA protocol.

## Introduction

The **Shop Floor Manager** is a comprehensive MES and ERP system designed to streamline manufacturing operations and optimize resource planning. It provides a centralized platform for managing and monitoring various aspects of the manufacturing process, including production scheduling, inventory management, order tracking, and more. The system was developed as a project for the "Industrial Informatics" course, demonstrating the integration of MES, ERP, XML order processing, and OPC UA connectivity. It is built using Python and leverages OPC UA for communication with PLCs.

## Features

- **Manufacturing Execution System (MES)**: The MES module offers real-time visibility into the shop floor, enabling users to monitor and control the manufacturing process, track work orders, and capture production data.

- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**: The ERP module provides a holistic view of the organization's resources, including inventory, procurement, sales, and finance. It integrates with the MES system to ensure accurate planning and resource allocation.

- **Master Production Schedule (MPS)**: The MPS module helps organizations create and manage a detailed production schedule, considering factors such as customer demand, inventory levels, and resource availability. It assists in optimizing production efficiency and meeting customer requirements.

- **XML Order Processing**: The system is capable of receiving orders in XML format, allowing seamless integration with external systems and partners for order management.

- **OPC UA Connectivity**: The system connects to Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) using the OPC UA protocol, enabling communication and data exchange with the shop floor equipment for real-time monitoring and control.
